    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's so easy to make your own cold-brewed coffee. If you make brewed coffee regularly, you have everything you need. Just keep a few glass jars or bottles on hand for storing the cold-brewed coffee, and you can have a cup any time you want.

        Put freshly coarse-ground beans into any kind of container (glass is usually best). Use your favorite roast, but make sure it's ground very coarsely so it won't cloud the water.
        Gently pour in cold, filtered water at a ratio of 4-to-1 (for example, 4 cups water for 1 cup grounds).
        Stir gently to make sure all grounds are wet and cover container with plastic wrap.
        Let it sit at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. Taste it occasionally and discard the grounds when the coffee hits your sweet spot.
